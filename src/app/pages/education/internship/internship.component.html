        During my internship at ETNIC's Innovation Center (R&D department), I worked as a Fullstack Developer to design
        and develop an internal web application aimed at document management and interactive chatbot integration. The
        key feature of this application was its ability to act as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system,
        allowing users to interactively query and discuss documents stored within the platform.

        The primary goal was to streamline document-related tasks and enable intuitive access to information,
        revolutionizing how employees interacted with organizational knowledge.

        <span>Key Contributions</span>
        <br>
        Throughout this internship, I collaborated closely with a small team of developers, working from the ground up
        to build a seamless and user-friendly application. My contributions included:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Frontend Development</b>:
            The user interface is built using Angular 17, TypeScript, Angular Material, HTML, and SCSS, ensuring an
            intuitive and accessible user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Backend API Implementation</b>:
            Developed the backend REST API with Python and FastAPI, ensuring robust performance and scalability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asynchronous Task Management</b>:
            Designed an efficient file upload system using Celery and Redis to handle long-running tasks asynchronously.
            This improved the system's performance and reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chatbot Integration</b>:
            Implemented a conversational AI chatbot using a RAG architecture powered by LangChain, generative AI
            (Mistral AI), and
            vector search. This allowed users to receive contextualized responses based on document content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Database Management</b>:
            Managed data storage with MongoDB Atlas for the main database and Redis for caching and task queuing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Testing and Quality Assurance</b>:
            Wrote and executed tests using Pytest to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Containerization and Deployment</b>:
            Utilized Docker for containerized development, ensuring consistent environments across local and cloud-based
            systems on Azure.
          </li>
        </ul>
